			The CasOT(Cas Off-Target) Program is a program to find potential off-target sites of given Cas target sequence in genomes, with user-specified types of protospacer adjacent motif, and number of mismatches allowed in the seed and non-seed regions.<br>
			<b>Note</b>: This program can only search off-target sites on genomes that are provided by us. If you want to search off-target site on other sequences, please use the downloadable version of CasOT <a href="http://eendb.zfgenetics.org/casot/">here</a>, in which you can search off-target sites on any sequences provided by you.
